# Power BI KPI Cards with Business Context

This project explores how to enhance KPI cards in Power BI by adding **contextual insights** to help users interpret performance metrics effectively.

## üîç Objective

While standard KPI cards show performance metrics, they often lack **context** ‚Äî the "why" behind the numbers. This project solves that by embedding:

- Conditional formatting

## üìä Features

- Highlighted highest and lowest sales peaks.
- Year-over-Year (YoY%) growth calculation
- Focus on business storytelling
- Conditional color logic: green (‚Üë), red (‚Üì)
- Directional arrows and accent bars for performance trends
- Visual emphasis via background highlighting
